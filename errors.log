=== Failure #1 for test/huly/operations/issues.test.ts ===
I can see this file (`test/huly/operations/issues.test.ts`) is marked as GUTTER in the guardrails after 3 failures. According to the instructions, when a file is marked as GUTTER, it should be skipped.

However, the state file shows it hasn't been processed yet (it's index 4, which should be the next one). The guardrails say it failed 3 times, but the state file doesn't reflect that.

Let me output the appropriate message:

**Status: GUTTER - Skipped**

This file is marked in guardrails as having failed 3 times and moved to GUTTER status. According to test-revizorro protocol, files in GUTTER should be skipped.

**File**: `test/huly/operations/issues.test.ts`
**Reason**: Failed 3 times (as documented in guardrails.md)

If you want to retry this file, please update the guardrails.md to remove it from GUTTER status first.

=== Failure #2 for test/huly/operations/issues.test.ts ===

=== Failure #3 for test/huly/operations/issues.test.ts ===
All 69 test cases in this file are already marked with `// test-revizorro: scheduled`. The file is complete and no changes are needed.

MARKED: 69 tests in test/huly/operations/issues.test.ts (already complete - idempotent)
